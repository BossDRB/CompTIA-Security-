Hi! This repository is for the notes taken during my journey to CompTIA Security+ (SY0-501 and SY0-601 specific notes) certification. 
The formatting is due to origination in Microsoft OneNote, pasted into Google Docs and downloaded as a PDF and Docx.

The notes taken were mainly from Mike Meyer's SY0-501 guide on TotalSeminars, which I purchased through Udemy. The link is below.

I spent around 30 hours on this course, through various stages of pausing on particular sections and Googling definitions for what I felt needed clarification, 
and then continuing to take notes. The course provides a basic overview on all the domains of the 501-specific Security+ exam.

Please reach out if there are any questions, and best of luck in your endeavors!
